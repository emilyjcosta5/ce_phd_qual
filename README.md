In order to benchmark the performance of algorithms ran on the sparse matrix implementations, I simply record the runtime of each function. Within each function, I convert the matrix into the respective representation then run SpMV on it. I decided to include the time to convert to the respective representations as that would be an additional step taken in production high-performance systems. The conversion would most likely be done when the matrix is compressed and stored prior to the matrix being inputted as a parameter. It should be noted that my conversion and SpMV implementations are not necessarily the most efficient ones nor are they run in parallel on a high-performance computing system.
